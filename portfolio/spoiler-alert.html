      <h1>Spoiler Alert!</h1> <br>
      <p>
        We kicked off Semester 4 with a 2 week sprint duo case project focused on the theme of 
        sustainable living. My partner and I came up with the idea for Spoiler Alert! Which is a mobile 
        app that helps students who live alone reduce food waste by tracking expiration dates of items in their fridge or pantry 
        and sending a notification when something is about to expire. <br> <br>

        I took on the role of Scrum Master, Designer, and Developer. I helped lead the process, 
        designed the user interface, and worked on building the app using Flutter, which was also 
        my first time creating a Flutter application. It was a big learning experience and a 
        great opportunity to build something real while picking up new skills. <br><br>

        We only had 2 users stories we wanted to accomplish with this project. <br>
        - As a user , I want to be able to easily add an item in my fridge <br>
        - As a user I want to be more aware of when my food is about to expire, 
        so that I donâ€™t unnecessarily waste it <br><br>

        What we delivered: <br>
        - A concept document <br>
        - Interactive prototype <br>
        - A Flutter apliccation <br>
        - Library research & Interviews related to the topic
